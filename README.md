# Hand Gesture Recognition

This project demonstrates a basic **Hand Gesture Recognition** system using computer vision techniques and machine learning models, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📄 Project Overview

The notebook covers the following steps:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Loading and preparing image data.
- **Model Building:** Designing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for gesture classification.
- **Training:** Training the model on the dataset.
- **Evaluation:** Measuring model performance.
- **Prediction:** Testing on sample gestures.
- **Visualization:** Displaying results with plots and images.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🖐️ Sample Gestures

- Thumbs Up 👍
- Peace ✌️
- Fist ✊
- Stop ✋
- OK 👌

*(Extendable to any custom gestures)*

## 📈 Model Performance

- Training Accuracy: _[Add after training]_
- Validation Accuracy: _[Add after training]_

## 📢 Future Improvements

- Expand the dataset with more hand gestures.
- Improve model accuracy with data augmentation.
- Deploy the model as a real-time web or mobile app.
